ðŸ¥… Keeper
========

A Gradle plugin that infers Proguard/R8 keep rules for androidTest sources.

Keeper hooks into R8 to add extra keep rules based on what androidTest classes use from the
target app's sources. This is necessary because the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) does not currently
factor in androidTest usages of target app sources when running the minification step, which can
result in runtime errors if APIs used by tests are removed.

This is (really) useful _only_ if you run your instrumentation tests against your minified release
builds! If you don't run these tests against minified builds, then you don't need this plugin. The
build type that you test against is controlled by the `testBuildType` flag, which is set to
`debug` by default.

This is a workaround until AGP supports this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/126429384.

**Note:** Keeper uses private APIs from AGP and could break between releases. It is currently
tested against AGP version `7.1.0` and `7.2.0-beta01` (or whatever `ci_agp_version` env
vars are described [here](https://github.com/slackhq/keeper/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Installation

Keeper is distributed via Maven Central. Apply the keeper Gradle plugin in your application's
build.gradle. Keeper requires Gradle 7.0 or higher and AGP 7.1.0 or higher.

Keeper can be consumed via regular gradle `plugins {}` block.

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("com.android.application") // <- Keeper only works with com.android.application!
  id("com.slack.keeper") version "x.y.z"
}
```

Note that we still publish to Maven Central, so you would need to add it to the repositories list
in `settings.gradle`.

```gradle
pluginsManagement {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral() // woo-hoo!
    gradlePluginPortal() // there by default
  }
}
```

Alternatively, it can be consumed via manual buildscript dependency + plugin application.

```groovy
buildscript {
  dependencies {
    // ...
    classpath "com.slack.keeper:keeper:x.y.z"
  }
}

apply plugin: "com.android.application" // <- Keeper only works with com.android.application!
apply plugin: "com.slack.keeper"
```

Full configuration defaults can be found on the [Configuration page](configuration.md).

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snapshots].

## Under the hood

The general logic flow:

* Create a custom `r8` configuration for the R8 dependency.
* Register two jar tasks per `androidTest` variant. One for all the classes in its target `testedVariant`
  and one for all the classes in the androidTest variant itself. This will use their variant-provided
  `JavaCompile` tasks and `KotlinCompile` tasks if available.
* Register a [`infer${androidTestVariant}UsageForKeeper`](https://github.com/slackhq/keeper/blob/main/keeper-gradle-plugin/src/main/kotlin/com/slack/keeper/InferAndroidTestKeepRules.kt)
  task that plugs the two aforementioned jars into R8's `PrintUses` CLI and outputs the inferred
  proguard rules into a new intermediate `.pro` file.
* Finally - the generated file is wired in to R8 via private task APIs and setting their
  `configurationFiles` to include our generated one.

Appropriate task dependencies (via inputs/outputs, not `dependsOn`) are set up, so this is
automatically run as part of the target app variant's full minified APK.

The tasks themselves take roughly ~20 seconds total extra work in our Slack android app, with the
infer and app jar tasks each taking around 8-10 seconds and the androidTest jar taking around 2 seconds.

## Core Library Desugaring (L8) Support

Library Desugaring (L8) was introduced in Android Gradle Plugin 4.0. To make this work, the R8 task
will generate proguard rules indicating which `j$` types are used in source, which the `L8DexDesugarLibTask`
then uses to know which desugared APIs to keep. This approach can have flaws at runtime though, as the
classpath of the test APK may not have the right `j$` classes available on its classpath to run app
code it is invoking. To work around this, Keeper does two things:

1. Keeper merges generated L8 rules from both the androidTest and target app to ensure they cover all
used APIs. These merged rules are given to the target app `L8DexDesugarLibTask`.
2. L8 will still, by default, generate a dex file of backported APIs into both the test app and target
app, which can cause confusing runtime classpath issues due to L8 generating different implementations
in each app. Keeper works around this by forcing the use of a single dex file in the target app and
preventing the inclusion of a backport dex file in the test app.

This L8 support is automatically enabled if `android.compileOptions.coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled` is
true in AGP.
