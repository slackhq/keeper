ðŸ¥… Keeper
========

A Gradle plugin that infers Proguard/R8 keep rules for androidTest sources.

Keeper hooks into Proguard/R8 to add extra keep rules based on what androidTest classes use from the
target app's sources. This is necessary because the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) does not currently
factor in androidTest usages of target app sources when running the minification step, which can
result in runtime errors if APIs used by tests are removed.

This is (really) useful _only_ if you run your instrumentation tests against your minified release
builds! If you don't run these tests against minified builds, then you don't need this plugin. The
build type that you test against is controlled by the `testBuildType` flag,  which is set to
`debug` by default.

This is a workaround until AGP supports this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/126429384.

**Note:** Keeper uses private APIs from AGP and could break between releases. We currently
support AGP 3.5.3, and will support 3.6 once it is released.

## Installation

Apply keeper _after_ the `android {}` block in your application's build.gradle file and configure
via the `keeper {}` extension.

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    // ...
  }

  dependencies {
    // ...
    classpath "com.slack.keeper:keeper:x.y.z"
  }

}

android {
  // ...
}

apply plugin: "com.slack.keeper"
keeper {
  /**
   * The name of the androidTest variant to infer for. This should include the "AndroidTest"
   * suffix. Required.
   */
  androidTestVariant = "yourAndroidTestVariantHere" // Required

  /** The name of the application variant to infer for. Required. */
  appVariant = "yourReleaseVariantHere"

  /** R8 version. Must be a tag. Optional, default defined below. */
  r8Version = "1.6.53"

  /**
   * Optional custom jvm arguments to pass into the R8 `PrintUses` execution. Useful if you want
   * to enable debugging in R8. Optional, default is empty.
   *
   * Example: `listOf("-Xdebug", "-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=5005,server=y,suspend=y")`
   */
  r8JvmArgs = []
}
```

### Dynamic Configuration

If you want to dynamically configure this, one approach we use internally is to define a `buildVariant`
gradle property and use its value to gate application of this plugin and which variant to use.

```groovy
if (project.hasProperty("buildVariant")) {
  String buildVariant = project.getProperty("buildVariant")
  apply plugin: 'com.slack.keeper

  keeper {
    androidTestVariant = "${buildVariant}AndroidTest"
    appVariant = buildVariant
  }
}
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snapshots].

## Under the hood

The general logic flow:
- Create a custom `r8` configuration for the R8 dependency.
- Register three jar tasks. One for all the classes in the app variant, one for all the classes in
  the androidTest variant, and one copy of the compiled android.jar for classpath linking. This
  will use their variant-provided `JavaCompile` tasks and `KotlinCompile` tasks if available.
- Register a [`inferAndroidTestUsage`](https://github.com/slackhq/keeper/blob/master/keeper-gradle-plugin/src/main/kotlin/com/slack/keeper/InferAndroidTestKeepRules.kt)
  task that plugs the two aforementioned jars into R8's `PrintUses` CLI and outputs the inferred
  proguard rules into a new intermediate `.pro` file.
- Finally - the generated file is wired in to Proguard/R8 via private `ProguardConfigurable` API.
  This works by looking for the relevant `TransformTask` that uses it.

Appropriate task dependencies (via inputs/outputs, not `dependsOn`) are set up, so this is
automatically run as part of the target app variant's full minified APK.

The tasks themselves take roughly ~20 seconds total extra work in our Slack android app, with the
infer and app jar tasks each taking around 8-10 seconds and the androidTest jar taking around 2 seconds.
